# Guessing A Number Game
Do you consider yourself as a lucky person? How is this feeling when compared to your relatives or friends? I know it might sound weird and a bit of a competitive question, but with this game, just for fun, you can check whether the luck is knocking on your door or flying miles from you.All you have to do is run the main.py script (with 2 numbers as arguments) and guess the generated number from the range specified.This is a single and multi-player game, meaning that you can play it on your own or with whoever you prefer.

Notes: running the scripts without passing arguments (it must be 2 integers) will raise an error. On the mult-player version, miss-spelling will be considered as failures and the next player will have the chance automatically. Moreover, in case of several attempts, some messages are displayed. The Python's sleep function is used to ensure they will be read for voice screen readers, something that wouldn't be possible if the script asks immediately a new prompt.

Good luck, if you find it!
(lol, just keeding, have fun)
